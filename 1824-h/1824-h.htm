    </p>
    <p>
      The scout stood where three roads cut three green tunnels in the pine
      woods, and met at his feet. Above his head an aged sign-post pointed
      impartially to East Carver, South Carver, and Carver Centre, and left the
      choice to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scout scowled and bit nervously at his gauntlet. The choice was
      difficult, and there was no one with whom he could take counsel. The three
      sun-shot roads lay empty, and the other scouts, who, with him, had left
      the main column at sunrise, he had ordered back. They were to report that
      on the right flank, so far, at least, as Middleboro, there was no sign of
      the enemy. What lay beyond, it now was his duty to discover. The three
      empty roads spread before him like a picture puzzle, smiling at his
      predicament. Whichever one he followed left two unguarded. Should he creep
      upon for choice Carver Centre, the enemy, masked by a mile of fir trees,
      might advance from Carver or South Carver, and obviously he could not
      follow three roads at the same time. He considered the better strategy
      would be to wait where he was, where the three roads met, and allow the
      enemy himself to disclose his position. To the scout this course was most
      distasteful. He assured himself that this was so because, while it were
      the safer course, it wasted time and lacked initiative. But in his heart
      he knew that was not the reason, and to his heart his head answered that
      when one's country is at war, when fields and fire-sides are trampled by
      the iron heels of the invader, a scout should act not according to the
      dictates of his heart, but in the service of his native land. In the case
      of this particular patriot, the man and scout were at odds. As one of the
      Bicycle Squad of the Boston Corps of Cadets, the scout knew what, at this
      momentous crisis in her history, the commonwealth of Massachusetts
      demanded of him. It was that he sit tight and wait for the hated
      foreigners from New York City, New Jersey, and Connecticut to show
      themselves. But the man knew, and had known for several years, that on the
      road to Carver was the summer home of one Beatrice Farrar. As Private
      Lathrop it was no part of his duty to know that. As a man and a lover, and
      a rejected lover at that, he could not think of anything else. Struggling
      between love and duty the scout basely decided to leave the momentous
      question to chance. In the front tire of his bicycle was a puncture,
      temporarily effaced by a plug. Laying the bicycle on the ground, Lathrop
      spun the front wheel swiftly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If," he decided, "the wheel stops with the puncture pointing at Carver
      Centre, I'll advance upon Carver Centre. Should it point to either of the
      two other villages, I'll stop here.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a two to one shot against me, any way," he growled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kneeling in the road he spun the wheel, and as intently as at Monte Carlo
      and Palm Beach he had waited for other wheels to determine his fortune, he
      watched it come to rest. It stopped with the plug pointing back to
      Middleboro.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scout told himself he was entitled to another trial. Again he spun the
      wheel. Again the spokes flashed in the sun. Again the puncture rested on
      the road to Middleboro.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it does that once more," thought the scout, "it's a warning that there
      is trouble ahead for me at Carver, and all the little Carvers."
    </p>
    <p>
      For the third time the wheel flashed, but as he waited for the impetus to
      die, the sound of galloping hoofs broke sharply on the silence. The scout
      threw himself and his bicycle over the nearest stone wall, and,
      unlimbering his rifle, pointed it down the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw approaching a small boy, in a white apron, seated in a white wagon,
      on which was painted, "Pies and Pastry. East Wareham." The boy dragged his
      horse to an abrupt halt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't point that at me!" shouted the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where do you come from?" demanded the scout.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wareham," said the baker.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you carrying any one concealed in that wagon?"
    </p>
    <p>
      As though to make sure the baker's boy glanced apprehensively into the
      depths of his cart, and then answered that in the wagon he carried nothing
      but fresh-baked bread. To the trained nostrils of the scout this already
      was evident. Before sunrise he had breakfasted on hard tack and muddy
      coffee, and the odor of crullers and mince pie, still warm, assailed him
      cruelly. He assumed a fierce and terrible aspect.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where are you going?" he challenged.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To Carver Centre," said the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      To chance Lathrop had left the decision. He believed the fates had
      answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dragging his bicycle over the stone wall, he fell into the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go on," he commanded. "I'll use your cart for a screen. I'll creep behind
      the enemy before he sees me."
    </p>
    <p>
      The baker's boy frowned unhappily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But supposing," he argued, "they see you first, will they shoot?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The scout waved his hand carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course," he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then," said the baker, "my horse will run away!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What of it?" demanded the scout. "Are Middleboro, South Middleboro, Rock,
      Brockton, and Boston to fall? Are they to be captured because you're
      afraid of your own horse? They won't shoot REAL bullets! This is not a
      real war. Don't you know that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The baker's boy flushed with indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure, I know that," he protested; "but my horse&mdash;HE don't know
      that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lathrop slung his rifle over his shoulder and his leg over his bicycle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If the Reds catch you," he warned, in parting, "they'll take everything
      you've got."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Blues have took most of it already," wailed the boy. "And just as
      they were paying me the battle begun, and this horse run away, and I
      couldn't get him to come back for my money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "War," exclaimed Lathrop morosely, "is always cruel to the innocent." He
      sped toward Carver Centre. In his motor car, he had travelled the road
      many times, and as always his goal had been the home of Miss Beatrice
      Farrar, he had covered it at a speed unrecognized by law. But now he
      advanced with stealth and caution. In every clump of bushes he saw an
      ambush. Behind each rock he beheld the enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a clearing was a group of Portuguese cranberry pickers, dressed as
      though for a holiday. When they saw the man in uniform, one of the women
      hailed him anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is the parade coming?" she called.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you seen any of the Reds?" Lathrop returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," complained the woman. "And we been waiting all morning. When will
      the parade come?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's not a parade," said Lathrop, severely. "It's a war!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The summer home of Miss Farrar stood close to the road. It had been so
      placed by the farmer who built it, in order that the women folk might sit
      at the window and watch the passing of the stage-coach and the peddler.
      Great elms hung over it, and a white fence separated the road from the
      narrow lawn. At a distance of a hundred yards a turn brought the house
      into view, and at this turn, as had been his manoeuvre at every other
      possible ambush, Lathrop dismounted and advanced on foot. Up to this
      moment the road had been empty, but now, in front of the Farrar cottage,
      it was blocked by a touring-car and a station wagon. In the occupants of
      the car he recognized all the members of the Farrar family, except Miss
      Farrar. In the station wagon were all of the Farrar servants. Miss Farrar
      herself was leaning upon the gate and waving them a farewell. The
      touring-car moved off down the road; the station wagon followed; Miss
      Farrar was alone. Lathrop scorched toward her, and when he was opposite
      the gate, dug his toes in the dust and halted. When he lifted his
      broad-brimmed campaign hat, Miss Farrar exclaimed both with surprise and
      displeasure. Drawing back from the gate she held herself erect. Her
      attitude was that of one prepared for instant retreat. When she spoke it
      was in tones of extreme disapproval.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You promised," said the girl, "you would not come to see me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lathrop, straddling his bicycle, peered anxiously down the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is not a social call," he said. "I'm on duty. Have you seen the
      Reds?"
    </p>
    <p>
      His tone was brisk and alert, his manner preoccupied. The ungraciousness
      of his reception did not seem in the least to disconcert him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Miss Farrar was not deceived. She knew him, not only as a persistent
      and irrepressible lover, but as one full of guile, adroit in tricks,
      fertile in expedients. He was one who could not take "No" for an answer&mdash;at
      least not from her. When she repulsed him she seemed to grow in his eyes
      only the more attractive.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not the lover who comes to woo," he was constantly explaining, "but
      the lover's WAY of wooing."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Farrar had assured him she did not like his way. She objected to
      being regarded and treated as a castle that could be taken only by
      assault. Whether she wished time to consider, or whether he and his
      proposal were really obnoxious to her, he could not find out. His policy
      of campaign was that she, also, should not have time to find out. Again
      and again she had agreed to see him only on the condition that he would
      not make love to her. He had promised again and again, and had failed to
      keep that promise. Only a week before he had been banished from her
      presence, to remain an exile until she gave him permission to see her at
      her home in New York. It was not her purpose to return there for two
      weeks, and yet here he was, a beggar at her gate. It might be that he was
      there, as he said, "on duty," but her knowledge of him and of the doctrine
      of chances caused her to doubt it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Lathrop!" she began, severely.
    </p>
    <p>
      As though to see to whom she had spoken Lathrop glanced anxiously over his
      shoulder. Apparently pained and surprised to find that it was to him she
      had addressed herself, he regarded her with deep reproach. His eyes were
      very beautiful. It was a fact which had often caused Miss Farrar extreme
      annoyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Mr. Lathrop?'" he protested. "You know that to you I am always 'Charles&mdash;Charles
      the Bold,' because I am bold to love you; but never 'Mr. Lathrop,'
      unless," he went on briskly, "you are referring to a future state, when,
      as Mrs. Lathrop, you will make me&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Farrar had turned her back on him, and was walking rapidly up the
      path.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beatrice," he called. "I am coming after you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Farrar instantly returned and placed both hands firmly upon the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot understand you!" she said. "Don't you see that when you act as
      you do now, I can't even respect you? How do you think I could ever care,
      when you offend me so? You jest at what you pretend is the most serious
      thing in your life. You play with it&mdash;laugh at it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man interrupted her sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's like this," he said. "When I am with you I am so happy I can't be
      serious. When I am NOT with you, it is SO serious that I am utterly and
      completely wretched. You say my love offends you, bores you! I am sorry,
      but what, in heaven's name, do you think your NOT loving me is doing to
      ME? I am a wreck! I am a skeleton! Look at me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He let his bicycle fall, and stood with his hands open at his sides, as
      though inviting her to gaze upon the ruin she had caused.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four days of sun and rain, astride of a bicycle, without food or sleep,
      had drawn his face into fine, hard lines, had bronzed it with a healthy
      tan. His uniform, made by the same tailor that fitted him with polo
      breeches, clung to him like a jersey. The spectacle he presented was that
      of an extremely picturesque, handsome, manly youth, and of that fact no
      one was better aware than himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look at me," he begged, sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Farrar was entirely unimpressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am!" she returned, coldly. "I never saw you looking so well&mdash;and
      you know it." She gave a gasp of comprehension. "You came here because you
      knew your uniform was becoming!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lathrop regarded himself complacently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, isn't it?" he assented. "I brought on this war in order to wear it.
      If you don't mind," he added, "I think I'll accept your invitation and
      come inside. I've had nothing to eat in four days."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Farrar's eyes flashed indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're NOT coming inside," she declared; "but if you'll only promise to
      go away at once, I'll bring you everything in the house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that house," exclaimed Lathrop, dramatically, "there's only one thing
      that I desire, and I want that so badly that 'life holds no charm without
      you.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Farrar regarded him steadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you intend to drive me away from my own door, or will you go?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lathrop picked his wheel out of the dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-by," he said. "I'll come back when you have made up your mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      In vexation Miss Farrar stamped her foot upon the path.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I HAVE made up my mind!" she protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then," returned Lathrop, "I'll come back when you have changed it."
    </p>
    <p>
      He made a movement as though to ride away, but much to Miss Farrar's
      dismay, hastily dismounted. "On second thoughts," he said, "it isn't right
      for me to leave you. The woods are full of tramps and hangers-on of the
      army. You're not safe. I can watch this road from here as well as from
      anywhere else, and at the same time I can guard you."
    </p>
    <p>
      To the consternation of Miss Farrar he placed his bicycle against the
      fence, and, as though preparing for a visit, leaned his elbows upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not wish to be rude," said Miss Farrar, "but you are annoying me. I
      have spent fifteen summers in Massachusetts, and I have never seen a
      tramp. I need no one to guard me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If not you," said Lathrop easily, "then the family silver. And think of
      your jewels, and your mother's jewels. Think of yourself in a house filled
      with jewels, and entirely surrounded by hostile armies! My duty is to
      remain with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Farrar was so long in answering, that Lathrop lifted his head and
      turned to look. He found her frowning and gazing intently into the shadow
      of the woods, across the road. When she felt his eyes upon her she turned
      her own guiltily upon him. Her cheeks were flushed and her face glowed
      with some unusual excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish," she exclaimed breathlessly&mdash;"I wish," she repeated, "the
      Reds would take you prisoner!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take me where?" asked Lathrop.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take you anywhere!" cried Miss Farrar. "You should be ashamed to talk to
      me when you should be looking for the enemy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am WAITING for the enemy," explained Lathrop. "It's the same thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Farrar smiled vindictively. Her eyes shone. "You need not wait long,"
      she said. There was a crash of a falling stone wall, and of parting
      bushes, but not in time to give Lathrop warning. As though from the
      branches of the trees opposite two soldiers fell into the road; around his
      hat each wore the red band of the invader; each pointed his rifle at
      Lathrop.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hands up!" shouted one. "You're my prisoner!" cried the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mechanically Lathrop raised his hands, but his eyes turned to Miss Farrar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you know?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have been watching them," she said, "creeping up on you for the last
      ten minutes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lathrop turned to the two soldiers, and made an effort to smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That was very clever," he said, "but I have twenty men up the road, and
      behind them a regiment. You had better get away while you can."
    </p>
    <p>
      The two Reds laughed derisively. One, who wore the stripes of a sergeant,
      answered: "That won't do! We been a mile up the road, and you and us are
      the only soldiers on it. Gimme the gun!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lathrop knew he had no right to refuse. He had been fairly surprised, but
      he hesitated. When Miss Farrar was not in his mind his amateur soldiering
      was to him a most serious proposition. The war game was a serious
      proposition, and that, through his failure for ten minutes to regard it
      seriously, he had been made a prisoner, mortified him keenly. That his
      humiliation had taken place in the presence of Beatrice Farrar did not
      lessen his discomfort, nor did the explanation he must later make to his
      captain afford him any satisfaction. Already he saw himself playing the
      star part in a court-martial. He shrugged his shoulders and surrendered
      his gun.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he did so he gloomily scrutinized the insignia of his captors.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who took me?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "WE took you," exclaimed the sergeant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What regiment?" demanded Lathrop, sharply. "I have to report who took me;
      and you probably don't know it, but your collar ornaments are upside
      down." With genuine exasperation he turned to Miss Farrar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord!" he exclaimed, "isn't it bad enough to be taken prisoner, without
      being taken by raw recruits that can't put on their uniforms?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Reds flushed, and the younger, a sandy-haired, rat-faced youth,
      retorted angrily: "Mebbe we ain't strong on uniforms, beau," he snarled,
      "but you've got nothing on us yet, that I can see. You look pretty with
      your hands in the air, don't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shut up," commanded the other Red. He was the older man, heavily built,
      with a strong, hard mouth and chin, on which latter sprouted a three days'
      iron-gray beard. "Don't you see he's an officer? Officers don't like being
      took by two-spot privates."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lathrop gave a sudden start. "Why," he laughed, incredulously, "don't you
      know&mdash;" He stopped, and his eyes glanced quickly up and down the
      road.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't we know what?" demanded the older Red, suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I forgot," said Lathrop. "I&mdash;I must not give information to the
      enemy&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      For an instant there was a pause, while the two Reds stood irresolute.
      Then the older nodded the other to the side of the road, and in whispers
      they consulted eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Farrar laughed, and Lathrop moved toward her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I deserve worse than being laughed at," he said. "I made a strategic
      mistake. I should not have tried to capture you and an army corps at the
      same time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You," she taunted, "who were always so keen on soldiering, to be taken
      prisoner," she lowered her voice, "and by men like that! Aren't they
      funny?" she whispered, "and East Side and Tenderloin! It made me homesick
      to hear them! I think when not in uniform the little one drives a taxicab,
      and the big one is a guard on the elevated."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They certainly are very 'New York,'" assented Lathrop, "and very tough."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought," whispered Miss Farrar, "those from New York with the Red Army
      were picked men."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What does it matter?" exclaimed Lathrop. "It's just as humiliating to be
      captured by a ballroom boy as by a mere millionaire! I can't insist on the
      invading army being entirely recruited from Harvard graduates."
    </p>
    <p>
      The two Reds either had reached a decision, or agreed that they could not
      agree, for they ceased whispering, and crossed to where Lathrop stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We been talking over your case," explained the sergeant, "and we see we
      are in wrong. We see we made a mistake in taking you prisoner. We had
      ought to shot you dead. So now we're going to shoot you dead."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can't!" objected Lathrop. "It's too late. You should have thought of
      that sooner."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know," admitted the sergeant, "but a prisoner is a hell of a nuisance.
      If you got a prisoner to look after you can't do your own work; you got to
      keep tabs on him. And there ain't nothing in it for the prisoner, neither.
      If we take you, you'll have to tramp all the way to our army, and all the
      way back. But, if you're dead, how different! You ain't no bother to
      anybody. You got a half holiday all to yourself, and you can loaf around
      the camp, so dead that they can't make you work, but not so dead you can't
      smoke or eat." The sergeant smiled ingratiatingly. In a tempting manner he
      exhibited his rifle. "Better be dead," he urged.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd like to oblige you," said Lathrop, "but it's against the rules. You
      CAN'T shoot a prisoner."
    </p>
    <p>
      The rat-faced soldier uttered an angry exclamation. "To hell with the
      rules!" he cried. "We can't waste time on him. Turn him loose!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The older man rounded on the little one savagely. The tone in which he
      addressed him was cold, menacing, sinister. His words were simple, but his
      eyes and face were heavy with warning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is running this?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little soldier muttered, and shuffled away. From under the brim of his
      campaign hat, his eyes cast furtive glances up and down the road. As
      though anxious to wipe out the effect of his comrade's words, the sergeant
      addressed Lathrop suavely and in a tone of conciliation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see," he explained, "him and me are scouts. We're not supposed to
      waste time taking prisoners. So, we'll set you free." He waved his hand
      invitingly toward the bicycle. "You can go!" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Miss Farrar's indignation Lathrop, instead of accepting his freedom,
      remained motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't!" he said. "I'm on post. My captain ordered me to stay in front
      of this house until I was relieved."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Farrar, amazed at such duplicity, exclaimed aloud:
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is NOT on post!" she protested. "He's a scout! He wants to stop here,
      because&mdash;because&mdash;he's hungry. I wouldn't have let you take him
      prisoner, if I had not thought you would take him away with you." She
      appealed to the sergeant. "PLEASE take him away," she begged.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sergeant turned sharply upon his prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why don't you do what the lady wants?" he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because I've got to do what my captain wants," returned Lathrop, "and he
      put me on sentry-go, in front of this house."
    </p>
    <p>
      With the back of his hand, the sergeant fretfully scraped the three days'
      growth on his chin. "There's nothing to it," he exclaimed, "but for to
      take him with us. When we meet some more Reds we'll turn him over. Fall
      in!" he commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" protested Lathrop. "I don't want to be turned over. I've got a much
      better plan. YOU don't want to be bothered with a prisoner. I don't want
      to be a prisoner. As you say, I am better dead. You can't shoot a
      prisoner, but if he tries to escape you can. I'll try to escape. You shoot
      me. Then I return to my own army, and report myself dead. That ends your
      difficulty and saves me from a court-martial. They can't court-martial a
      corpse."
    </p>
    <p>
      The face of the sergeant flashed with relief and satisfaction. In his
      anxiety to rid himself of his prisoner, he lifted the bicycle into the
      road and held it in readiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're all right!" he said, heartily. "You can make your getaway as quick
      as you like."
    </p>
    <p>
      But to the conspiracy Miss Farrar refused to lend herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you know," she demanded, "that he will keep his promise? He may
      not go back to his own army. He can be just as dead on my lawn as anywhere
      else!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lathrop shook his head at her sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How you wrong me!" he protested. "How dare you doubt the promise of a
      dying man? These are really my last words, and I wish I could think of
      something to say suited to the occasion, but the presence of strangers
      prevents."
    </p>
    <p>
      He mounted his bicycle. "'If I had a thousand lives to give,'" he quoted
      with fervor, "'I'd give them all to&mdash;'" he hesitated, and smiled
      mournfully on Miss Farrar. Seeing her flushed and indignant countenance,
      he added, with haste, "to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts!"
    </p>
    <p>
      As he started on his wheel slowly down the path, he turned to the
      sergeant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm escaping," he explained. The Reds, with an enthusiasm undoubtedly
      genuine, raised their rifles, and the calm of the Indian summer was
      shattered by two sharp reports. Lathrop, looking back over his shoulder,
      waved one hand reassuringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Death was instantaneous," he called. He bent his body over the
      handle-bar, and they watched him disappear rapidly around the turn in the
      road.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Farrar sighed with relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you very much," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      As though signifying that to oblige a woman he would shoot any number of
      prisoners, the sergeant raised his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't mention it, lady," he said. "I seen he was annoying you, and that's
      why I got rid of him. Some of them amateur soldiers, as soon as they get
      into uniform, are too fresh. He took advantage of you because your folks
      were away from home. But don't you worry about that. I'll guard this house
      until your folks get back."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Farrar protested warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really!" she exclaimed; "I need no one to guard me."
    </p>
    <p>
      But the soldier was obdurate. He motioned his comrade down the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Watch at the turn," he ordered; "he may come back or send some of the
      Blues to take us. I'll stay here and protect the lady."
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Miss Farrar protested, but the sergeant, in a benign and fatherly
      manner, smiled approvingly. Seating himself on the grass outside the
      fence, he leaned his back against the gatepost, apparently settling
      himself for conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, how long might it have been," he asked, "before we showed up, that
      you seen us?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I saw you," Miss Farrar said, "when Mr.&mdash;when that bicycle scout was
      talking to me. I saw the red bands on your hats among the bushes."
    </p>
    <p>
      The sergeant appeared interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why didn't you let on to him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Farrar laughed evasively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maybe because I am from New York, too," she said. "Perhaps I wanted to
      see soldiers from my city take a prisoner."
    </p>
    <p>
      They were interrupted by the sudden appearance of the smaller soldier. On
      his rat-like countenance was written deep concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When I got to the turn," he began, breathlessly, "I couldn't see him.
      Where did he go? Did he double back through the woods, or did he have time
      to ride out of sight before I got there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The reappearance of his comrade affected the sergeant strangely. He sprang
      to his feet, his under jaw protruding truculently, his eyes flashing with
      anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get back," he snarled. "Do what I told you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Under his breath he muttered words that, to Miss Farrar, were
      unintelligible. The little rat-like man nodded, and ran from them down the
      road. The sergeant made an awkward gesture of apology.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuse me, lady," he begged, "but it makes me hot when them rookies won't
      obey orders. You see," he ran on glibly, "I'm a reg'lar; served three
      years in the Philippines, and I can't get used to not having my men do
      what I say."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Farrar nodded, and started toward the house. The sergeant sprang
      quickly across the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you ever been in the Philippines, Miss?" he called. "It's a great
      country."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Farrar halted and shook her head. She was considering how far
      politeness required of her to entertain unshaven militiamen, who insisted
      on making sentries of themselves at her front gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sergeant had plunged garrulously into a confusing description of the
      Far East. He was clasping the pickets of the fence with his hands, and his
      eyes were fastened on hers. He lacked neither confidence nor vocabulary,
      and not for an instant did his tongue hesitate or his eyes wander, and yet
      in his manner there was nothing at which she could take offence. He
      appeared only amiably vain that he had seen much of the world, and anxious
      to impress that fact upon another. Miss Farrar was bored, but the man gave
      her no opportunity to escape. In consequence she was relieved when the
      noisy approach of an automobile brought him to an abrupt pause. Coming
      rapidly down the road was a large touring-car, filled with men in khaki.
      The sergeant gave one glance at it, and leaped across the road, taking
      cover behind the stone wall. Instantly he raised his head above it and
      shook his fist at Miss Farrar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't tell," he commanded. "They're Blues in that car! Don't tell!" Again
      he sank from sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Farrar now was more than bored, she was annoyed. Why grown men should
      play at war so seriously she could not understand. It was absurd! She no
      longer would remain a party to it; and, lest the men in the car might
      involve her still further, she retreated hastily toward the house. As she
      opened the door the car halted at the gate, and voices called to her, but
      she pretended not to hear them, and continued up the stairs. Behind her
      the car passed noisily on its way.
    </p>
    <p>
      She mounted the stairs, and crossing a landing moved down a long hall, at
      the further end of which was her bedroom. The hall was uncarpeted, but the
      tennis shoes she wore made no sound, nor did the door of her bedroom when
      she pushed it open.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the threshold Miss Farrar stood quite still. A swift, sinking nausea
      held her in a vice. Her instinct was to scream and run, but her throat had
      tightened and gone dry, and her limbs trembled. Opposite the door was her
      dressing-table, and reflected in its mirror were the features and figure
      of the rat-like soldier. His back was toward her. With one hand he swept
      the dressing-table. The other, hanging at his side, held a revolver. In a
      moment the panic into which Miss Farrar had been thrown passed. Her breath
      and blood returned, and, intent only on flight, she softly turned. On the
      instant the rat-faced one raised his eyes, saw her reflected in the
      mirror, and with an oath, swung toward her. He drew the revolver close to
      his cheek, and looked at her down the barrel. "Don't move!" he whispered;
      "don't scream! Where are the jewels?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Farrar was not afraid of the revolver or of the man. She did not
      believe either would do her harm. The idea of both the presence of the man
      in her room, and that any one should dare to threaten her was what filled
      her with repugnance. As the warm blood flowed again through her body her
      spirit returned. She was no longer afraid. She was, instead, indignant,
      furious.
    </p>
    <p>
      With one step she was in the room, leaving the road to the door open.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get out of here," she commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little man snarled, and stamped the floor. He shoved the gun nearer to
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The jewels, damn you!" he whispered. "Do you want me to blow your fool
      head off? Where are the jewels?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jewels?" repeated Miss Farrar. "I have no jewels!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You lie!" shrieked the little man. "He said the house was full of jewels.
      We heard him. He said he would stay to guard the jewels."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Farrar recognized his error. She remembered Lathrop's jest, and that
      it had been made while the two men were within hearing, behind the stone
      wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was a joke!" she cried. "Leave at once!" She backed swiftly toward the
      open window that looked upon the road. "Or I'll call your sergeant!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you go near that window or scream," whispered the rat-like one, "I'll
      shoot!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A heavy voice, speaking suddenly from the doorway, shook Miss Farrar's
      jangled nerves into fresh panic.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She won't scream," said the voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the door Miss Farrar saw the bulky form of the sergeant, blocking her
      escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without shifting his eyes from Miss Farrar, the man with the gun cursed
      breathlessly at the other. "Why didn't you keep her away?" he panted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "An automobile stopped in front of the gate," explained the sergeant.
      "Have you got them?" he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" returned the other. "Nothing! She won't tell where they are."
    </p>
    <p>
      The older man laughed. "Oh, yes, she'll tell," he whispered. His voice was
      still low and suave, but it carried with it the weight of a threat, and
      the threat, although unspoken, filled Miss Farrar with alarm. Her eyes,
      wide with concern, turned fearfully from one man to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sergeant stretched his hands toward her, the fingers working and
      making clutches in the air. The look in his eyes was quite terrifying.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you don't tell," he said slowly, "I'll choke it out of you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      If his intention was to frighten the girl, he succeeded admirably. With
      her hands clasped to her throat, Miss Farrar sank against the wall. She
      saw no chance of escape. The way to the door was barred, and should she
      drop to the garden below, from the window, before she could reach the road
      the men would overtake her. Even should she reach the road, the house
      nearest was a half mile distant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sergeant came close, his fingers opening and closing in front of her
      eyes. He raised his voice to a harsh, bellowing roar. "I'm going to make
      you tell!" he shouted. "I'm going to choke it out of you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Although she was alone in the house, although on every side the pine woods
      encompassed her, Miss Farrar threw all her strength into one long,
      piercing cry for help. And upon the instant it was answered. From the hall
      came the swift rush of feet. The rat-like one swung toward it. From his
      revolver came a report that shook the room, a flash and a burst of smoke,
      and through it Miss Farrar saw Lathrop hurl himself. He dived at the
      rat-like one, and as on the foot-ball field he had been taught to stop a
      runner, flung his arms around the other's knees. The legs of the man shot
      from under him, his body cut a half circle through the air, and the part
      of his anatomy to first touch the floor was his head. The floor was of
      oak, and the impact gave forth a crash like the smash of a base-ball bat,
      when it drives the ball to centre field. The man did not move. He did not
      even groan. In his relaxed fingers the revolver lay, within reach of
      Lathrop's hand. He fell upon it and, still on his knees, pointed it at the
      sergeant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're MY prisoner, now!" he shouted cheerfully. "Hands up!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The man raised his arms slowly, as if he were lifting heavy dumb-bells.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The lady called for help," he said. "I came to help her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! No!" protested the girl. "He did NOT help me! He said he would choke
      me if I didn't&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He said he would&mdash;what!" bellowed Lathrop. He leaped to his feet,
      and sent the gun spinning through the window. He stepped toward the man
      gingerly, on the balls of his feet, like one walking on ice. The man
      seemed to know what that form of approach threatened, for he threw his
      arms into a position of defence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You bully!" whispered Lathrop. "You coward! You choke women, do you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He shifted from one foot to the other, his body balancing forward, his
      arms swinging limply in front of him. With his eyes, he seemed to undress
      the man, as though choosing a place to strike.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I made the same mistake you did," he taunted. "I should have killed you
      first. Now I am going to do it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He sprang at the man, his chin still sunk on his chest, but with his arms
      swinging like the spokes of a wheel. His opponent struck back heavily,
      violently, but each move of his arm seemed only to open up some vulnerable
      spot. Blows beat upon his chin, upon his nose, his eyes; blows jabbed him
      in the ribs, drove his breath from his stomach, ground his teeth together,
      cut the flesh from his cheeks. He sank to his knees, with his arms
      clasping his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get up!" roared Lathrop. "Stand up to it, you coward!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But the man had no idea of standing up to it. Howling with pain, he
      scrambled toward the door, and fled staggering down the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same moment the automobile that a few minutes before had passed up
      the road came limping to the gate, and a half-dozen men in uniform sprang
      out of it. From the window Lathrop saw them spread across the lawn and
      surround the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They've got him!" he said. He pointed to the prostrate figure on the
      floor. "He and the other one," he explained, breathlessly, "are New York
      crooks! They have been looting in the wake of the Reds, disguised as
      soldiers. I knew they weren't even amateur soldiers by the mistakes in
      their make-up, and I made that bluff of riding away so as to give them
      time to show what the game was. Then, that provost guard in the motor car
      stopped me, and when they said who they were after, I ordered them back
      here. But they had a flat tire, and my bicycle beat them."
    </p>
    <p>
      In his excitement he did not notice that the girl was not listening, that
      she was very pale, that she was breathing quickly, and trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll go tell them," he added, "that the other one they want is up here."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Farrar's strength instantly returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a look of terror at the now groaning figure on the floor, she sprang
      toward Lathrop, with both hands clutching him by his sleeves.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will NOT!" she commanded. "You will not leave me alone!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Appealingly she raised her face to his startled countenance. With a burst
      of tears she threw herself into his arms. "I'm afraid!" she sobbed. "Don't
      leave me. Please, no matter what I say, never leave me again!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Between bewilderment and joy, the face of Lathrop was unrecognizable. As
      her words reached him, as he felt the touch of her body in his arms, and
      her warm, wet cheek against his own, he drew a deep sigh of content, and
      then, fearfully and tenderly, held her close.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a pause, in which peace came to all the world, he raised his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't worry!" he said. "You can BET I won't leave you!"
    </p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
